Thank you for taking the time to meet with me yesterday to discuss your project needs. I appreciated the opportunity to learn more about your goals and the challenges you're facing.

Based on our conversation about ${meetingContext}, I wanted to follow up with some additional thoughts and resources that might be helpful as you consider next steps.

Would you be available for a brief call next week to discuss this further? I'm available Tuesday or Thursday afternoon if either works for you.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
${userName}
${userEmail}`;
